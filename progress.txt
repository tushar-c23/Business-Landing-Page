07/10/2022 - Completed the header with a navbar completely responsive with dimensions using 2 media breakpoints and had to deploy js (DOM used need to understand and study better after learning more about DOM). Until now feel like i have started to develop an understanding of CSS and i hope until the end of this project i'll have quite a good grip over CSS.
