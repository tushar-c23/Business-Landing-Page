07/10/2022 - Completed the header with a navbar completely responsive with dimensions using 2 media breakpoints and had to deploy js (DOM used need to understand and study better after learning more about DOM). Until now feel like i have started to develop an understanding of CSS and i hope until the end of this project i'll have quite a good grip over CSS

09/10/2022 - Completed the hero animated part. Used a complete section to coontain a div which wraps over the contents of the section which has an image which is animated to float up and down which was executed using webkit-keyframes, i.e used translateY type of transform. Configured the header and a headline and 2 buttons using css. Used  media queries to make the contents responsive.
